    "**You are at a Pokemon black market planning to buy a Pokemon for battle. All Pokemon are sold at the same price and you can only afford to buy one. You cannot choose which specific Pokemon to buy. However, you can specify the type of the Pokemon - one type that exists in either `Type 1` or `Type 2`. Which type should you choose in order to maximize your chance of receiving a good Pokemon?**\n",

For now, is there a way to consolidate the fields we need to look into?\n",

The `.loc[:, stat_columns]` part means that we are taking all the rows of the dataframe but only the columns that we put in the `stat_columns` variable. We then use `.sum(axis=1)` to sum them all in the row direction. If we use `axis=0` (which is also the default values, therefore leaving it blank would have the same effect) would mean that pandas would apply the sum function to each column.\n",

The idea is to gather all the possible string values in a categorical field and create a numerical field for each unique string value. Each of those numerical fields uses `1` and `0` to indicate whether the data record has the corresponding categorical value. A detailed explanation of One Hot Encoding can be found in [this article](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-one-hot-encoding-why-and-when-do-you-have-to-use-it-e3c6186d008f). You will formally learn it in Module 3.\n",

    "#### In the next cell, use One Hot Encoding to encode `Type 1` and `Type 2`. Use the pokemon type values as the names of the numerical fields you create.\n",
